# 🕋 Quran Data Calligraphy & Silhouette

This project is a unique blend of **Data Visualization** and **Islamic Art**. It maps the verse counts (Ayat) of the 114 Surahs of the Quran onto a line chart to create a meaningful silhouette of the word **"Allah" (الله)** in Arabic calligraphy style.



## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic Data Mapping:** Every peak and valley in the graph represents the actual verse count of a Surah (from Nas to Fatiha).
- **Cinematic Mode:** An automated animation that breathes life into the visualization by pulsing the width and perspective.
- **Interactive Tooltips:** Hover over the graph to see the specific Surah name and its verse count.
- **Customizable Aesthetics:** Control the gold gradient intensity, line tension (smoothness), and overlay opacity in real-time.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Modern, dark-themed control panel with blurred backgrounds.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Custom animations and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic and interactivity.
- **Chart.js:** Powering the complex data visualization.
- **Google Fonts:** Using 'Amiri' for calligraphy and 'Cinzel' for the header.
